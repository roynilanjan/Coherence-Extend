# Coherence-Extend

This is a sample program demonstrating how to setup Coherence extend which is also known as Coherence client server setup.

Coherence Extend allows you to access remote Coherence caches using standard Coherence APIs you are already familiar with,
which means that with some care you can make your applications protocol-agnostic and be able to switch between TCMP and Extend 
using configuration. It also allows you to submit entry processors and invocable agents for execution within the cluster, 
which is particularly useful when you need to overcome some of the inherent limitations of Coherence Extend.
